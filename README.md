This project highlights key features and functionalities of C++:

✨ ASCII Art Welcome Message: Adds a fun and engaging start to the game.

🎲 Random Number Generation: Utilizes rand() and srand() to generate a random number between 1 and 100 each time the game runs.

👨‍💻 User Input Handling: Ensures smooth gameplay by managing invalid inputs gracefully, guiding users to enter valid numbers.

🔄 Interactive Gameplay: Continuously prompts users to guess the number, providing real-time feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low.

🏆 Custom Congratulations Message: Rewards users with personalized messages based on the number of attempts they take to guess correctly.

💡 Key C++ Concepts: Demonstrates the use of functions, loops, conditionals, and input/output operations.

Building this game was a great way to reinforce my C++ skills and have some fun along the way. Try it out and let me know how many attempts it took you to guess the number! 🎉
